Our food project

## Name
Foodbase

## Description
This web-application is developed for bringing together people with
excess food and people with a need for food.
The application helps reduce food waste and also brings good spirit
to the community.

###Principles
1. Mobile first 
2. User privacy and security (Although security is not top notch currently)
3. Ease of use (intuitive UI)

###Different roles in the application
-Anonymous users can:
    -Browse the feed
    -Open posts
    -Search for posts with keywords and filters

-Registered users can do the same, plus:
    -Get their feed automatically filtered according to their preferences
    -Send messages to post authors and chat with them
    -Flag disturbing posts
    -Create posts and edit them
    -Edit their profile and change password (email not editable)
    -Delete their posts or their account

-Moderators can do the same, plus:
    -See all flagged posts, the amount of reports per post and the report messages for each post
    -Delete clearly inappropriate posts that have been reported multiple times

## Installation

## Roadmap
